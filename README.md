# REACT.js 'Mesto' (Place') interactive web page student project for [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.com) with registration and authorization

## [Check out the project on GitHub Pages](https://anastasiiauferova.github.io/mesto-react/)

## Description

This project is an nteractive gallery where users can share photos. The main concepts and techs I practiced working on the project: React.js Functional Components, useState, useEffect hooks, Asynchronous JavaScript, Fetch API. The data is loaded from and onto external API provided by Yandex.

This project has been ported to the React.js framework from the pure [JavaScript OOP based project](https://github.com/AnastasiiaUferova/mesto).

## Functionality:

* Add new cards;
* Delete cards created by the user;
* "Like" and "dislike" photos;
* Expand the photos by clicking on them (pop-up shows up)
* Close the picture popup by clicking on "X";
* Editing user profile information including name, description and avatar;
* Communication with external API to fetch and patch/delete data

## Technologies:

* React.js Functional Components;
* Hooks (useState, useEffect);
* Adaptive layout using flexbox and grid positioning;
* Nested file structure according to BEM methodology;
* JavaScript (Asynchronous JS, Fetch API, OOP);
* Git;
* Webpack;
* Figma

## Installation instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/AnastasiiaUferova/mesto-react

cd mesto-react

npm install 

npm run build

npm run start
```
## Future project development

In the subsequent sprints, login, registration and authorization were added to the project, making it a [more complex multi-page one](https://github.com/AnastasiiaUferova/react-mesto-auth).
